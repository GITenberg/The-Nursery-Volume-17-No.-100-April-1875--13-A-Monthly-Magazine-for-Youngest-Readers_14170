<p>The beautiful picture of The Cataract of Lodore, in our present number,
is well illustrated by Southey's famous lines which were written for his
little boys and girls, or, as he phrased it, &quot;for the nursery.&quot;</p>

<p>We call special attention to the illustration of &quot;The First Corner&quot; on
page <a href="#Page_117">117</a>. It is a design by Perkins, exquisitely engraved by John Andrew
&amp; Son.</p>

<p>&quot;The Boy who loved his mother&quot; is another picture that is worthy of
special notice. The &quot;Drawing-Lesson&quot; by Weir, should attract the
attention of all children who want to learn to draw.</p>

<p>Canvassers will find from our terms that we offer them rare inducements
for extending the circulation of &quot;The Nursery.&quot; It is poor economy, even
in the hardest times, for parents to neglect what may largely contribute
to the education of their children.</p>

<p>&quot;The Easy Book&quot; and &quot;The Beautiful Book,&quot; are now recognized as Standard
works for the young, and continue to be in great demand. To these we
shall soon add &quot;The Nursery Primer,&quot; which will surpass everything of
the kind yet got up.</p>

<p>&quot;Next to a baby,&quot; writes a subscriber in Charlotte, Mich., &quot;there never
was such joy in a household as 'The Nursery.' My little girl will repeat
nearly every poem, though she does not know a letter. My boy is just
two, and such a yell of delight when he finds a '<i>bow-wow</i>,' as he calls
the dog, all to himself, would astonish a Piute Indian. I don't have to
keep any 'cramp drops,' 'baby jumpers' or 'patent food,'(?) for the
children. I find they never have an ail or grievance, but 'The Nursery'
acts as a specific. I wish every mother in the land would give it to her
children on trial. And really it makes old people feel quite sunny.&quot;</p>

<p>It will be seen by a notice in our advertising pages, that the Publisher
of &quot;The Nursery&quot; is prepared to execute various commissions in the way
of purchasing and forwarding books, Maps, Games, Stationery, &amp;c., for
parties desiring them.</p>

<p><img src="images/04.gif" width="100" alt="W" title="W" />hen Felix was a little fellow, hardly two years old, he used to pet his
mother, and tell her how much he loved her.</p>

<p>As he grew up, he showed his love by his acts. He minded his mother; he
gave her his attention when she talked to him; and, if she told him not
to do a thing, he would not do it.</p>

<p>If she said, &quot;Felix, don't do that,&quot; he would not fret, and say, &quot;Why
not, mother?&quot; Oh, no! He would at once give up what he was doing; for he
knew she would not, without some good reason, forbid him to do a thing
that pleased him.</p>

<p>Once, when Felix had grown to be six years old, his mother took him with
her on a journey in the railroad-cars to New York. It was a fine day in
June: the windows of the cars were open.</p>

<p>&quot;Felix,&quot; said his mother, as they took their seats, &quot;you may sit by the
window; but you must not put your head or your arms out of it.&quot;</p>

<p>Before she could explain to him her reasons for saying this, a friend
who had come in drew off her attention, by talking to her; so that she
forgot to explain to Felix why she did not wish to have him put his head
or arms out of the window.</p>

<p>In the seat just before him, Felix saw a large boy, who kept putting his
head out, although the boy's mother kept telling him not to do it. By
and by the cars rushed by a post, which stood so near the track that it
almost grazed the boy's head. He started back in a great fright, losing
his hat as he did so. He had a very narrow escape.</p>

<p>Felix now saw why his mother had given him the caution <!-- Page 99 --><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99" />she had. He took
her hand in his, and looked up in her face. She smiled on him; for she
knew what was passing in his mind.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Felix,&quot; said she: &quot;if you had not loved your mother too much to
wound her by disobedience, you might have lost your life.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="FROWING_AWAY_ONE" id="FROWING_AWAY_ONE" />FROWING AWAY ONE.</h2>


<p>I know three little girls who are sisters. Of course, they ought to love
each other dearly. When they stand up, they are like a flight of three
steps: baby is the lowest; Mattie is the middle step; and Susie is the
upper step, because she is tallest.</p>

<p>The baby is four years old, I know: so I guess that Mattie is almost
six, and Susie a little more than seven.</p>

<p>No two of you little people love each other more dearly than Mattie and
baby love each other. Where one is, the other always wants to be. They
sit and walk with their arms around each other. It is pleasant to see
them.</p>

<p>They both dearly love Susie too; but she is bigger, and doesn't seem to
belong quite so much to them as they seem to belong to each other.</p>

<p>One day their mamma was looking at them; and, thinking aloud, she said,
&quot;Three little girls! What shall I do with so many? Don't you think I
have too many?&quot;</p>

<p>Then baby looked earnestly into her mother's face, and said, &quot;O, mamma!
if you <i>must</i> frow one away, do frow away Susie.&quot;</p>

<p>Never you fear, little people, that Susie will be &quot;frowed&quot; away. Her
mamma has not one too many, though she has three little girls.</p>

<p>The Easter-egg is a painted or colored egg used for a present at Easter,
a day which occurs on Sunday, the second day after Good-Friday.</p>

<p>The term &quot;Easter&quot; is said to be derived from a Saxon word meaning
<i>rising</i>; and Easter is a festival of the Christian Church to
commemorate the resurrection.</p>

<p>In the picture, the children are hunting for Easter-eggs, which the good
mother has hidden in different parts of the room. The child who finds
the most eggs will have the pleasure of making presents of them to whom
he or she may choose.</p>

<p>Baby has set his eyes on the egg that lies on the floor. If he takes it
up, I hope he will not let it fall, and break it. The other children
will not be slow to find the painted eggs. There must be a dozen, or
more, of them hidden away.</p>

<h2><a name="OUR_CHRISTMAS_PLAY" id="OUR_CHRISTMAS_PLAY" /><!-- Page 102 --><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102" />OUR CHRISTMAS PLAY.</h2>


<p>Our Emily wrote a play for our Christmas entertainment. Emily, Ruth,
Mary, and Uncle Peter, all took part in it. The curtain fell amid very
great applause from grandma, grandpa, father, and Uncle Charles,
Brothers Robert and John, Jane, the housemaid, Aunt Alice, and some six
of our cousins. So you see we had a good audience. As it is the only
play we have ever seen acted, we may be too partial critics; but readers
must judge for themselves.</p>


<p>(EMILY <i>enters with a basket of shoestrings</i>)</p>

<p>EMILY.&mdash;Shoestrings to sell! Does anybody want shoestrings? Dear me, how
cold it is! To-morrow is Christmas, and I must earn money enough to buy
a basket of coal. Who wants a nice pair of shoestrings?</p>

<p>RUTH (<i>entering</i>).&mdash;This is a cold day, little girl, and you are thinly
clad. Now, if my Uncle Peter, were here I know what he would do: he
would buy you a shawl.</p>

<p>EMILY.&mdash;As soon as I get rich, I mean to buy one myself. Can I sell you
a pair of shoestrings?</p>

<p>RUTH.&mdash;What is the price?</p>

<p>EMILY.&mdash;Only two cents a pair.</p>

<p>RUTH.&mdash;Then you may give me three pairs. Here are six cents. (<i>Takes out
her purse, and pays</i> EMILY, <i>but, in putting it back, lets it fall on
the ground.</i>)</p>

<p>EMILY.&mdash;Thank you; and a merry Christmas to you!</p>

<p>RUTH.&mdash;I wish I could make your Christmas a merry one, poor child; but I
have done what I could. Good-by. (<i>Goes out.</i>)</p>

<p>EMILY.&mdash;Oh, if more such customers would come along, how glad I should
be! Will any one buy a nice pair of shoestrings? (<i>Sees the purse, and
picks it up.</i>) What is this on the ground? A purse! And it has money in
it. One dollar, three dollars&mdash;Dear me! That young lady must have
dropped it. I must run and give it to her. Where is she? (<i>Puts down her
basket, and goes out.</i>)</p>

<p>(MARY <i>enters, and looks at the basket.</i>)</p>

<p>MARY.&mdash;A basket on the sidewalk! What does it mean? (<i>Takes it up.</i>) It
is full of shoestrings. I will take it to my mother, and ask her <!-- Page 103 --><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103" />to
find the owner. (MARY <i>takes up the basket, and is going out, when</i> RUTH
<i>enters.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><a href="images/09.gif"><img src="images/09.gif" width="400" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>RUTH.&mdash;Are you the girl I bought shoestrings of?</p>

<p>MARY.&mdash;No: I have not sold any. These are not mine.</p>

<p>RUTH.&mdash;Have you seen any thing of a purse about here?</p>

<p>MARY.&mdash;No: I have seen no purse. (<i>Goes off-with the basket.</i>)</p>

<p>RUTH.&mdash;- Oh! here comes the little girl I was looking for; and she has
my purse in her hand. (<i>Enter</i> EMILY.) That is my purse, little girl.</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>giving</i> RUTH <i>the purse</i>).&mdash;Take it. I was looking for you. But
where is my basket of shoestrings?</p>

<p>RUTH.&mdash;Why, that little girl yonder has it. See her there, crossing the
street.</p>

<p>EMILY.&mdash;It is my basket. She has taken what does not belong to her.</p>

<p><!-- Page 104 --><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104" />
RUTH.&mdash;Run, and bring her to me. (EMILY <i>starts to go out.</i>) Stop! What
is your name?</p>

<p>EMILY.&mdash;Emily Swift.</p>

<p>RUTH.&mdash;Well, Emily Swift, I think you are mistaken in supposing that the
little girl meant to steal your basket. Bring her to me. (EMILY <i>goes
out.</i>) What a pleasant thing it would be to have a purse so full, that
one could keep on giving from it, and never find it empty! But here come
the children.</p>

<p>(EMILY <i>leads in</i> MARY).</p>

<p>EMILY.&mdash;Here she is. She says she was taking the basket to her mother,
so that her mother might find the owner.</p>

<p>RUTH.&mdash;And do you doubt her word?</p>

<p>EMILY.&mdash;Doubt her word? Not I! She is too good a little girl to tell a
falsehood. Just look in her face, and you will see that she speaks the
truth.</p>

<p>RUTH.&mdash;Yes, Emily Swift, you are right.</p>

<p>EMILY.&mdash;Goodness me! What is that thing coming this way?</p>

<p>MARY.&mdash;I am afraid of it. Is it a man?</p>

<p>RUTH.&mdash;As I live, it is Uncle Peter!</p>

<p>EMILY.&mdash;Who is Uncle Peter?</p>

<p>Arthur had been looking at some pictures in a book; but he did not quite
understand what they were: so he called on Uncle Oscar to explain.</p>

<p>Uncle Oscar took him on his knee, and said, &quot;This, Arthur, is a picture
of the flax-plant, a very useful plant indeed; for from it we make
linen. Your apron is linen: so are the collar and wristbands on my
shirt.</p>

<p>&quot;<!-- Page 108 --><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108" />The flax-plant bears delicate blue flowers, which look very pretty
when in bloom. Flax is raised very largely in Kentucky, and other States
in the Union. Do you know what part of the plant is the stalk? I will
point it out to you in the picture.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="images/14.gif"><img src="images/14.gif" width="300" alt="FLAX." title="FLAX." /></a></p>
<h5>FLAX.</h5>

<p>&quot;Well, from this stalk the thread, or fibres, are got, out of which
linen cloth is made. The flax is pulled a little before the seeds are
ripe: it is stripped, and the stalks are soaked in water. The flax is
then dried, and broken and beaten till the threads, or fibres, of the
bark are fit for spinning. From the seeds, linseed-oil is made.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it not strange, Arthur, that out of the stalk of this little plant
should be made the nice white linen of your apron and my handkerchief?&quot;</p>

<p><!-- Page 109 --><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109" />Arthur thought it very strange. Then, pointing to another picture, he
said, &quot;What's this, Uncle Oscar?&quot;</p>

<p class="center"><a href="images/15.gif"><img src="images/15.gif" width="300" alt="BARLEY." title="BARLEY." /></a></p>
<h5>BARLEY.</h5>

<p>&quot;That, Arthur, is a picture of barley as it grows in the field. It
yields a very useful kind of grain. You have eaten it in soup, and also
boiled. Stripped of the husk, and rounded and polished in a mill, the
grains are pearly white; and then they are known as pearl-barley.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here's another picture, Uncle Oscar.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you ever eat rye-bread, Arthur?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, yes, Uncle Oscar! we had it for breakfast.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, here is a picture of rye as it grows in the field. It is one of
the best of grain-bearing grasses. It will grow <!-- Page 110 --><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110" />where the weather is
very cold. The straw is often worth almost as much as the grain.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="images/16.gif"><img src="images/16.gif" width="300" alt="RYE." title="RYE." /></a></p>
<h5>RYE.</h5>

<p>&quot;Rye grows on poor, light soils, which are altogether unfit for the
wheat out of which we make our white bread. Sometimes we mix rye-flour
with wheaten-flour, or with corn-meal, and so get a very good kind of
bread.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can I plant some flax-seed, and barley, and rye?&quot; asked Arthur.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, my boy,&quot; said Uncle Oscar. &quot;You shall have some to plant in your
garden next May. I think you will be pleased with the flax-plant,
because of its pretty blue-flower.&quot;</p>

<p>We give here another outline from Landseer for our little readers to
copy. Perhaps they would like to know something about Sir Edwin
Landseer. He was born in London, in 1803, and died less than two years
ago.</p>

<p>He belonged to a family of artists. His father and elder brother were
skilful engravers. His brother Charles earned high rank as a painter.
But Edwin was the most famous of them all.</p>

<p>While yet a child, no bigger than some of the young-readers of &quot;The
Nursery,&quot; he showed a great taste for drawing. He had an especial
fondness for drawing animals. His father encouraged him by giving him
pictures to copy; and soon his skill in copying became so great that his
father took him into the fields, and taught him to draw animals from
life.</p>

<p>In this way he soon acquired correct notions of color; and, at the age
of fourteen, he began to attract attention by his spirited paintings of
dogs, horses, and other animals. He continued to improve until he became
one of the most celebrated artists of his day. In 1850, he was knighted
by Queen Victoria, that is to say, he received the honorary title of
<i>Sir</i> Edwin Landseer.</p>

<p>Mr. Harrison Weir, whose name is well known to our readers, is another
English artist, who makes a specialty of the same department of art in
which Landseer became so famous. His sketches are remarkable for their
truth to nature, and many of them would do no discredit to Landseer
himself.</p>

<p>Lay a piece of thin paper over the drawing-lesson, and trace the lines
of the picture. After a little practice, try to copy it without-tracing.</p>

<h2>A SMART HORSE.</h2>


<p>One morning, when the men went to the stable, our horse, Jenny, was
missing from her stall. On looking around, they found her in another
room, eating meal out of a chest.</p>

<p>Now, in order to do this thing, she must not only have untied her
halter, but have unfastened and opened a door, and raised the lid of the
chest; all of which were supposed to have been left safely closed.</p>

<p>We thought that she could not have done it all, but that some careless
person had left the chest open, and the door unfastened. So Jenny was
led back to her stall and tied up; the lid of the chest was shut down,
and the door closed and fastened with a hook.</p>

<p>About an hour afterwards, on entering the stable again, Madam Jenny was
found as before, with her nose deep in the meal-chest, munching away
with great relish. Then we <i>knew</i> she must have unhooked and opened the
door, and raised the cover, as well as unhooked her halter.</p>

<p>Do you not think she was pretty smart for a horse? Papa says it was more
smart than honest to steal meal in that way. But I suppose horses do not
know much about honesty.</p>

<p>I liked Jenny all the better for her smartness, and I have made a great
pet of her since. As she is so fond of meal, I take care to give her so
much that she will not have to steal it.</p>

<p>She comes to me when I call her; for she knows that I am her friend, and
she often gets an apple from my hand. She looks at me so kindly through
her great eyes, that I am sure she would thank me if she could speak.</p>

<p>This is a real true story. MARY.</p>

<h2><a name="ABOUT_SOME_INDIANS" id="ABOUT_SOME_INDIANS" /><!-- Page 115 --><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115" />ABOUT SOME INDIANS.</h2>

<p class="center"><a href="images/21.gif"><img src="images/21.gif" width="600" alt="" /></a></p>


<p>Some boys and girls think Indians are dreadful beings; but my boy,
Vaughn, who is now more than three years old, thinks them a very good
sort of people. He was born in the Indian country, and is quite used to
them and their odd ways.</p>

<p>He often used to stand in the doorway, and say, &quot;How, how?&quot; to them as
they passed by; and they would smile, and say, &quot;How, how?&quot; back again.
This is the Indian way of saying, &quot;How do you do?&quot;</p>

<p>One day I was at work in the cellar, when I heard strange voices at the
front-door: so I went out to sec what was the matter. In front of the
house I found quite a number of Indian braves, with their squaws and
pappooses, all riding on sorry-looking ponies.</p>

<p>They had drawn up before the house, and were trying to <!-- Page 116 --><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116" />make Vaughn and
his mamma understand that they were thirsty. One of the braves had a dog
under his blanket; and the little fellow looked very queer as he poked
his head out, and watched us. I pointed the band to the town-well, a
short distance down the street; and they said, &quot;Ugh!&quot; and rode away in
Indian-file.</p>

<p>Another day, an old Indian, with a nose like a young elephant's, rode up
to the drug-store, and asked, in Indian lingo, for some tobacco. The
druggist cut off a large slice of &quot;black navy,&quot; and, stepping out on the
sidewalk, handed it to the happy old fellow, who, returning his thanks
by sundry nods and grunts, opened the folds of his blanket, and drew out
the most laughable tobacco-pouch you ever saw. As sure as you live, it
was a whole skunk-skin, with jaws, teeth, ears, and all!</p>

<p>Just as he was about to drive away, the lady-teacher and a drove of boys
and girls came pouring out of the school-room. The Indian looked a
little blank, and, glancing first at the lady and then at the children,
remarked admiringly, &quot;Heap squaw! heap pappoose!&quot; (The innocent old wild
gentleman had taken them all for one family).</p>

<p>A chief with his two squaws and two pappooses were coaxed into a
picture-car, one day, to be photographed. They seemed afraid of the
three-legged animal with the round glass eye; but, at last, one of the
squaws was induced to take her seat, baby in arms. The baby bawled
lustily, till I quieted him by jingling a bunch of keys, while the
artist got the focus.</p>

<p>Then I glanced through the camera, and the sight was so pretty and
queer, that I induced the chief to take a peep; and when he saw the very
minute copy of his spouse and child, standing on their heads, he nearly
shook himself to pieces with silent laughter.</p>

<p>Most of the sugar we use is made from the sugar-cane, which grows in
warm countries. But in France they make a good deal of sugar from beets;
and in North America, where the sugar-maple-tree grows, some very nice
sugar is made from its sap.</p>

<p>Early in spring, while the weather is yet cold, and before the trees
have begun to show many signs of life, it is the time for tapping the
maples.</p>

<p>The sun, which has already begun to make his power felt by melting the
snow, and leaving great green patches here and there on the cleared
lands, has kissed the rugged trunks of the trees, and has set the sweet
sap mounting through every vein and tissue.</p>

<p>Now is the time to set the troughs in order, and to bore the holes for
the little spouts through which the juice must run. These must be made a
foot from the ground, on the sunny side of the tree; and very soon the
drip, drip, of the oozing <!-- Page 124 --><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124" />sap will be heard, as it trickles over the
spout into the rough bowls placed to catch it at the foot of every
maple.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="images/30.gif"><img src="images/30.gif" width="600" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>As each trough fills, the juice is poured, first into a large barrel,
and from thence, when all is ready, into the great iron pot, or caldron,
slung over the wood-fire on three poles.</p>

<p>In the picture, you may see three brothers, with their two sisters,
engaged in collecting the sap, and boiling it till it can be cooled as
sugar. If you will look sharp, you can see little bowls placed at the
root of some of the trees, and the sap flowing into them.</p>

<p>A syrup is made from the sap, which is very delicate, and is much used
for buckwheat-cakes. A large quantity of maple-sugar is made every year
in the northern part of the United States, and in Canada. But it cannot
be made so as to compete with the sugar of the sugar-cane in cheapness.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="images/31.gif"><img src="images/31.gif" width="450" alt="" /></a></p>


<p>Once there were two little sparrows who built for themselves a nest on a
small tree by the wayside. The mother-bird laid four little eggs in it;
and there she sat, while her mate chirped merrily on a tree near by,
till, one fine day in May, four little sparrows were hatched.</p>

<p>How glad the parent-birds were! and how they flew round to get food for
their little ones! They were willing <!-- Page 126 --><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126" />almost to starve themselves, so
that their children might not suffer from want.</p>

<p>Oh, what hungry children they were! How they would stretch out their
necks, and open their bills for food, as father and mother drew near to
feed them! And what queer little noises they would make, as if they were
saying, &quot;Feed <i>me</i> first! Oh, give <i>me</i> that nice little worm! No, <i>I</i>
am the hungriest, give it to <i>me</i>! Me first! Me first!&quot;</p>

<p>But the parent-birds seemed to know which of the children had not had a
full share; for they would always give it to those who needed it most.</p>

<p>But one day, one sad day, a man came by with his cart, and, seeing the
nest, took it with all the little birdies, and placed it on some straw
in his cart.</p>

<p>The parent-birds, wild with grief, flew round and round, but it was of
no use. Then they followed the cart, and continued to feed their young
as well as they could, though the cart was in motion.</p>

<p>But a little girl, whose name was Laura, and who was taking a walk with
her mother, saw the man remove the nest, and at once made up her mind to
try and get it away from him.</p>

<p>So she went up, and asked him if he would let her have the nest, if she
paid him for it. The man seemed a little ashamed when he saw Laura and
her mother; and he replied, &quot;Well, little girl, it didn't cost me any
thing, and so you may have it for nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I thank you ever so much!&quot; cried Laura. So she took the nest, with
the birdies in it; and then she and her mother found a safe place in the
notch of a tree, hidden from the road, and there they placed it.</p>

<p>Then they walked away, and stood at a distance, and watched till they
saw the parent-birds fly down from a high <!-- Page 127 --><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127" />branch to their own nest, and
again begin to feed their little ones. How they twittered and chirped
with joy! The feeling that she had made the birds happy made Laura happy
too.</p>

<p>Every day, for a week, she came to see how the little family were
getting on. On the eighth day the nest was empty. They had all flown
away.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
